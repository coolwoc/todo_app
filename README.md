GULP, SASS and AngularJS 

** work in progess **


Hi Folks!
This is a work in progress. A small-app I am working right now. I will like to demostrate my technical knowledge using Angular. All the features of the app are custom or using the power of angular as framework.

 Gulp is used to automated the front-end task.
 
 I had worked on the archictecture, layout and design of the app. However, img assets like logo have been grabbed from internet. The purpouse of this application is not commercial. This is a pret-project. The architecture of the project is based on SMACS - a scalable and modular architecture for the sass/css - and John Papa style guides for a more abstract/modular JS/Angular.

As mentioned above this app is in progress!!
