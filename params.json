Gulp ( a task automata for the front-end app ), SASS ( using modular architecture ) and ANGULAR ( with the primary use $resource and ui-router).\r\n\r\n##GULP\r\nIt is a build system to automate tasks. The file is in progress and DEPLOYMENT task has not been develop yet as I prioritise PRODUCTION tasks at the minute.\r\n\r\n##SASS\r\nApplied [SMACS](https://smacss.com/), a modular architecture which allows to reuse CSS across the project.\r\n\r\n##ANGULAR\r\nFollowed [John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) style-guides to be able to write a more consistent and reusable abstract/OOP code.\r\n\r\n##GIT\r\nAll the stable code will be in MASTER. I will branch the next features of the app and merge them when they are stable enough.\r\n\r\n##THIRD PARTY\r\n* [Font Squirell](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/) - Allows to embed fonts in css file with a good render without the need of using JS.\r\n* [Iconic-font](https://useiconic.com/open/) - Opens source icons.\r\n* [Json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) - Used to handle locally $resource request from db.json file.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
