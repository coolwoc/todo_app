	<h2>Hi folks!</h2>
	
	<p>This is a small todo-app I have develop in the last days. I will like to demostrate my technical knowledge of Angular using primary $resource and ui-router. Two of the most poweful features of the framework on my understanding. All the features of the app are custom or using the power of Angular as a framework.</p>
	<p>I had worked on the layout and design of the app. However, img assets like logo have been grabbed from internet. <i>The purpose of this application is not commercial</i>. This is a pet-project.</p>
	<p>I use GULP to automate the front-end tasks.</p>
	<p>The architecture of the project is based on SMACS - a more scalabel and modular architecture for the SASS/CSS - and John Papa style guides for a more abstract/modular ANGULAR</p>
	<p>If you want to give feedback or have any questions please don't hesitate to contact by email.</p>
	<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
