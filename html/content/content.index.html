	<h2>Hi folks!</h2>

    <p>This is a small application which you can achieve the following:</p>

    <ul class='tasksInfo'>
    	<li>The user can add tasks</li>
    	<li>They can edit and removed tasks</li>
    	<li>
    		The application filters by:
    		<ul>
		    	<li>[] Task done.</li>
		    	<li>[] Task archived.</li>
		    	<li>[] Next 7 days tasks.</li>
		    	<li>[] Daily tasks.</li>
		    </ul>
    	</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Some technical info:</h3>
    <p>I had worked on the layout and design of the app. However, img assets like logo have been grabbed from internet. <i>The purpose of this application is not commercial</i>. This is a pet-project.</p>
	<p>I use GULP to automate the front-end tasks.</p>
	<p>The architecture of the project is based on SMACS - a more scalabel and modular architecture for the SASS/CSS - and John Papa style guides for a more abstract/modular ANGULAR</p>
	<p>Hope you enjoy it.</p>
